# Sea Battle v0.1.1
Sea Battle is my first python project via github.
I used it to get known with git system and with `PySide2` library as well.

### Still need to make:
+ Create a player click handler in the game
+ Write a simple logic to an enemy bot
+ Create game loop
+ Fix some bugs

# Sea Battle v0.2.0
Sea Battle is my first python project via github.
I created it to get known with git, creating GUI, css and PyQt library.
